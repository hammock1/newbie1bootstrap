Practice building website with Bootstrap 3 and using Git

The purpose/goal of this exercise is to: 

1) Follow along a tutorial to build a Bootstrap 3 website from start to finish
2) Practice using Git (I last used Git 5 months ago). I need to revise my basic Git commands so that I can learn more advanced Git commands
3) Use this very same website and create a similar version  using my own code and Boostrap 4


Here is the video I plan to follow verbatim:
